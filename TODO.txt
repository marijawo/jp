For a working example of using Flask-Security with Flask-Admin, have a look at
https://github.com/flask-admin/Flask-Admin/tree/master/examples/auth.

Now, you’ll need to manually pass in some context variables for the Flask-Admin templates to render correctly
when they’re being called from the Flask-Security views. Defining a security_context_processor function will take
care of this for you:
def security_context_processor():
    return dict(
        admin_base_template=admin.base_template,
        admin_view=admin.index_view,
        h=admin_helpers,
    )

In the navigation menu, components that are not accessible to a particular user will not be displayed for that user.
For an example of using Flask-Login with Flask-Admin, have a look at
https://github.com/flask-admin/Flask-Admin/tree/master/examples/auth-flask-login.
